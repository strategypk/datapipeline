positive,@united thanks
positive,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
neutral,@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?

negative,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."

negative,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad

negative,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
negative,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
negative,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.

neutral,"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
negative,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
negative,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
negative,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
negative,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
negative,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."

negative,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
neutral,@united yall should probably work on that.
negative,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
negative,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.

positive,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
negative,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
negative,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"

negative,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
negative,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
negative,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
negative,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
negative,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
negative,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
positive,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
negative,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
negative,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
negative,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
positive,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."

neutral,"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
negative,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
negative,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
negative,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?

negative,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
negative,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
negative,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit

positive,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
negative,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
negative,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"

negative,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.

positive,@united I wanna be grand staff
negative,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."

negative,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
negative,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
negative,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
negative,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead

negative,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."

negative,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
negative,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic

negative,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."

negative,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
negative,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
negative,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
negative,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
